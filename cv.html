Respected HR, <br>


I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my sincere interest in the opportunities available at Google India. As a highly motivated and enthusiastic computer science student, I am eager to contribute my skills and passion to a company renowned for its innovation and commitment to excellence.

Throughout my academic journey at Keshav Memorial Institute of Technology, where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science, I have consistently demonstrated a strong aptitude for programming and a keen interest in cutting-edge technologies. <br>
<br>
With a current GPA of 7.69/10.0, I have gained a solid foundation in languages such as Java, HTML, CSS, and basic Python. My coursework has also equipped me with expertise in database management using SQL and a deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.

One of my proudest achievements is the development of a cryptocurrency exchange app using Flutter, a project I completed in February 2023. This project allowed me to integrate blockchain technology into a user-friendly Flutter application, deploying smart contracts on the Sepolia test network for seamless token swapping functionality and real-time Ethereum price tracking. This experience has honed my skills in Flutter, smart contract development, and version control with Git and GitHub.

In May 2023, I completed the "Current Location on Map" project, which demonstrates my proficiency in mobile app development using Android Studio, Google Maps API, and Location Services API. This project showcases my ability to create functional and accurate mobile applications. <br>
<br>

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and knowledge to Google, a company that has consistently pushed the boundaries of technology. Google's commitment to innovation aligns perfectly with my own aspirations, and I am eager to be part of a team that shapes the future of technology.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my background and experiences align with Google's vision and the specific opportunities within your organization. Please find my resume attached for your reference.

Sincerely,

A VARUN KUMAR
